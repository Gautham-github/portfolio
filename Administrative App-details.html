            <h3>Design Brief</h3>

            <p>
              Starting with the inspiration board, I picked the most relevant themes and collated them into wireframes. This sets the standards that must be followed through out the project and to improve the digital presence of the application.
            </p>

            <h3>Main Goal</h3>

            <p>
              The main goal of this project was to understand the business logic and produce interactive User Interfaces. I am not supposed to reveal the entire design, wireframes, logo, animated video and task flow of this project because of confidentiality. But, let me brief you on the outline of the application.
            </p>
          
            <h3 >Outline </h3>          

            <p>It consists of three modules. Each module holds more than ten tasks. These not only allow the user to do their day-to-day activities but also keep them updated about them. All of these are managed both on a mobile device and a central server hosted on the web. The most challenging part of designing this application is that it must provide a standard, consistent and attractive UI that invites users to use the application. Doing so makes the data storage and access much faster.</p>
            
            <h3>Post Promotion Works</h3>

            <p>
              The application is easy to use and has various features to help the users get familiar with it. Designed a well-fit logo that meets the purpose of the application. Also, Made an animated video that enables businesses to strategically communicate with the users, expressing the application's value and facilitating a positive user experience.
