            <p>
             A campus recruitment framework, a web application that I designed for the manangement which consists of three sets of modules that are student login, company login and admin login. The project is useful for college students, training and placements officers(TPO) also the various companies visiting the campus for recruitment.
            </p>

             <p>
             The application allows the students to make their profiles and upload all their details including their marks onto the system. It also consists of a system login where various companies visiting the campus can view an inventory of students therein college and also their respective resumes.
            </p>

             <p>
             The software allows students to look at an inventory of companies. The admin has overall rights over the system and may moderate and delete any details concerning college placement rules. The management system documents and manages students also as company data and efficiently displays all this data to respective sides.
            </p>
           

      <h3>Main Goal of the Project</h3>

            <p>
              The aim of this framework is to constructively manage student information. The framework also manages student as well as company data efficiently and shows all the data to respective sides.
            </p>
            <p>I aim to answer the following questions through this research:</p>
            <p>● Is it possible to create a web application for a University?</p>
            <p>● Is it possible to predict the main criteria for campus recruitment ?</p>
            <p>● Which technique can make the academic campus hiring with highest manipulation?</p>

      <h3 >Problem Statement </h3>          

            <p>Unlike earlier systems in web applications are poor in maintaining and processing the data of the users where the introduced framework makes untethered processing and manipulating the data across the different sites.</p>
            
      <h3>Problem Approach</h3>

            <p>
             Concerning an individual 's knowledge in his/her professional career is an intellectual task that depends on interlinking the subsets of ideas over an interface is a huge process, so before we step into a complicated process flow. We identify and correct the flaws at the existing system by reviewing its old repositories, thereby evaluating the progress by means of a survey or a feedback.
            </p>

            <p>
              Collaborating the records with an individual's knowledge is highly enhanced to navigate over the different set domain system.
            </p>

            <p>
              Use of external sources which are designed are relatively to enhance a complex application in a smoother way to achieve a targeted system. Here by integrating the web application with the one another modules are dealt with framework approach.
            </p>

      <h3>Methodology</h3>

            <p>
             The framework holds three sets of modules such as admin, hirer and student. One another is placed on the same registration and login interface that contains the mail id, and password fields, also with some basic inputs, where data will be validated and login to the system.
            </p>

            <p>
            Student - After filling details at the student profile details interface, the students will be taken to the dashboard, where they can see the campus hiring data and tasks assigned to them. Also they can see the companies arriving on our campus with their job description, eligibility criteria and other required information that are assigned by the company.            </p>

            <p>
              Admin or TPO - Placement Officers can post schedules and tasks about companies at the student and hirer interfaces. They can provide feedback about the company from the students end after collecting from the student feedback interface. TPO’s can have a discussion with the students through the inbox interface.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hirer - On Campus recruiters can make their registration with the respective college. The student profile, links , documents, students applied will be available at the hirer interface. The shortlisted members for further rounds will be available at the shortlisted students tag. Companies can take the feedback from the Placement Officer and from the students as well.
            </p>

    <h3>Merits</h3>

            <p>
             Campus hiring for the recruiters enhances more advantage when compared to the earlier system. User interfaces are designed user friendly for the HR to steer to the respective web pages. The complete flow of processes for setting the required inputs are highly categorized to the respective modules. Students involvement over their module drives the hiring system much more usable to upsolve the complicated hiring process which exists till now.
            </p>

            <p>
              Secondly, students can download the resources available online which are uploaded by the HR or TPO. A single step of confirmation to apply for any company is the major part of this framework. Even admin works like adding and removal of placed and unplaced students are made easy at this site which can also be executed over respective sides of modules.
            </p>

            <p>
             Framework meets the heavy tasks like getting rid of time consuming interfaces where even an end user can interact with the site effortlessly.
            </p>

     <h3>Demerits </h3>          

            <p>Updating and screening each student status is hard to manipulate the site. Data privacy is challenging at both the corporate company and management end. Maintaining the servers would be the biggest factor. If student traffic increases at the site there may be the chance of a crash at the framework.</p>
